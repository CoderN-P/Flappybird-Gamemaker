# Flappybird-Gamemaker
This is my first time trying out Game Maker after using it in school. So, I made a simple flappy-bird type game.

# Instructions to use

- Download the zipped folder using the "Code" button on github.
- Extract the full folder from the zipped folder by double clicking it.
- Rename the full folder to "Flappy Bird"
- Move this "Flappy Bird" folder to the "GameMakerStudio2" folder
- Open the "Flappy Bird" folder and double click the "Flappy Bird.yyp" file
